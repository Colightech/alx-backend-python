Introduction to Unit Tests and Integration Tests
Software testing is a crucial aspect of the development lifecycle, ensuring the quality, reliability, and performance of applications. Among the various testing methodologies, Unit Tests and Integration Tests stand out as fundamental practices.

Unit Tests
Unit tests focus on verifying the functionality of individual components or units of a software application, typically the smallest testable parts such as functions or methods. The primary goal of unit testing is to ensure that each unit of the software performs as expected in isolation. Developers write these tests to validate that their code works correctly before integrating it into the larger codebase. Unit tests are usually automated, providing quick feedback and facilitating continuous integration and delivery processes.

Integration Tests
Integration tests, on the other hand, validate the interaction between multiple components or modules of a software application. After individual units have been tested, integration tests check that these units work together as intended. This type of testing aims to identify issues that may arise from the interaction between integrated components, such as data flow problems, interface mismatches, and unexpected behavior. Integration testing is essential for ensuring that the combined parts of the system function cohesively, ultimately contributing to the robustness and reliability of the application.

In summary, while unit tests ensure the correctness of individual components in isolation, integration tests focus on the seamless collaboration of these components within the system, both playing vital roles in the overall software quality assurance process.
