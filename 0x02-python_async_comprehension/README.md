# Project Name
0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

# introduction:
Python Async Comprehensions, introduced in Python 3.6, allow for concise and efficient asynchronous iteration over iterable objects. Similar to synchronous comprehensions, which generate lists, sets, and dictionaries, async comprehensions produce asynchronous iterators that can be used within async functions or coroutines. This feature leverages the power of Python's asyncio module, enabling developers to perform non-blocking I/O operations concurrently, thus improving the efficiency and responsiveness of their asynchronous code.
