# project name
0x01. Python - Async

# introduction:
Python's asynchronous programming, often referred to as async programming, allows developers to write concurrent code that is efficient and responsive. The asyncio module introduced in Python 3.4 provides a framework for writing asynchronous code using coroutines, enabling tasks to run concurrently without the need for threading or multiprocessing.

Async programming in Python revolves around the extensive use of coroutines and the await keyword. Coroutines are functions that can be paused and resumed, allowing other code to run in the meantime. The await keyword is used to pause execution until an asynchronous operation completes, making it easy to write code that performs I/O-bound tasks efficiently.

Async programming is particularly useful for applications that require handling many I/O-bound operations, such as web servers, networking applications, or data processing pipelines. By leveraging async techniques, developers can create highly scalable and responsive applications while avoiding the overhead of traditional threading or multiprocessing approaches.

In summary, Python's async programming enables developers to write concurrent code that is both efficient and easy to understand, making it a powerful tool for building high-performance applications
